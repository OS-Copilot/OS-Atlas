# Evaluation and Test Prompts

## Evaluation Scripts
We update the evaluation scripts for reference in the path of ``eval_scripts/``. Current evaluation scripts support AndroidControl, GUI Odyssey, GUIAct-Web and OmniACT.
You can evaluate the model response with the following command:

```python
# for android control
python eval_scripts/android_control/evaluation_unify.py
```

## Test Data Samples
We include the test data in the directory of ``data/``. For simplicity, a few of the samples are included for prompt reference. You can also find the detailed prompt in our paper [OS-Atlas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23218).
