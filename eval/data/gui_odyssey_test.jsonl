They allow for flexibility and adaptability, enabling the model to support new and unseen actions defined by users. These actions extend the functionality of the basic set, making the model more versatile and capable of handling specific tasks.\n\n\nCustom Action 1: LONG_PRESS \n    - purpose: Long press at the specified position.\n    - format: LONG_PRESS <point>[[x-axis, y-axis]]</point>\n    - example usage: LONG_PRESS <point>[[101, 872]]</point>\n\nCustom Action 2: PRESS_BACK\n    - purpose: Press a back button to navigate to the previous screen.\n    - format: PRESS_BACK\n    - example usage: PRESS_BACK\n\nCustom Action 3: PRESS_HOME\n    - purpose: Press a home button to navigate to the home page.\n    - format: PRESS_HOME\n    - example usage: PRESS_HOME\n\nCustom Action 4: PRESS_RECENT\n    - purpose: Press the recent button to view or switch between recently used applications.\n    - format: PRESS_RECENT\n    - example usage: PRESS_RECENT\n\nCustom Action 5: IMPOSSIBLE\n    - purpose: Wait for the screen to load.\n    - format: WAIT\n    - example usage: WAIT\n\nCustom Action 6: COMPLETE\n    - purpose: Indicate the task is finished.\n    - format: COMPLETE\n    - example usage: COMPLETE\n\n\nIn most cases, task instructions are high-level and abstract.
